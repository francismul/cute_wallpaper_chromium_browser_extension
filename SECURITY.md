## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Cute Wallpapers Extension seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to the project maintainer via:
   - GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
   - Direct message to project maintainer
   - Email with "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, data exposure, privilege escalation)
- **Description** of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Affected versions** (if known)
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Update**: Every week until resolved
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to user data or system security | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Significant security risk | 1 week |
| **Medium** | Moderate security concern | 2-4 weeks |

## Security Features

The Cute Wallpapers Extension implements several security measures:

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: API keys stored locally in browser storage
- **No Data Collection**: No user data is transmitted to external servers
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use secure HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP prevents code injection

### API Security
- **Key Validation**: API keys are validated before use
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of external APIs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- **Fallback Content**: Safe fallback when APIs are unavailable

### Extension Security
- **Manifest V3**: Uses latest security standards
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions
- **Content Script Isolation**: Proper isolation from web pages
- **Secure Communication**: Background script communication is secure

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys
- API keys are stored in Chrome's local storage
- Users should keep API keys confidential
- Regularly rotate API keys for better security

### Content Loading
- Images and videos are loaded from trusted sources (Unsplash, Pexels)
- Content is cached locally for performance and offline use
- No user-generated content is processed

### Browser Permissions
The extension requests these permissions:
- `storage`: For settings and cache management
- `activeTab`: For new tab functionality
- Network access to Unsplash and Pexels APIs

## Security Updates

When security vulnerabilities are fixed:

1. **Immediate Release**: Critical vulnerabilities get immediate patch releases
2. **Version Bumping**: Security fixes increment the patch version
3. **Changelog**: All security fixes are documented in CHANGELOG.md
4. **User Notification**: Users are advised to update immediately

## Best Practices for Users

### Installation
- Only install from official Chrome Web Store or GitHub releases
- Verify the extension ID matches the official version
- Review permissions before installation

### API Keys
- Obtain API keys directly from Unsplash and Pexels
- Never share API keys publicly
- Use environment variables or secure storage for keys
- Rotate keys regularly

### Updates
- Enable automatic updates in your browser
- Check for security updates regularly
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

## Third-Party Dependencies

We monitor all third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- Regular dependency audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Prompt updates for security issues
- Minimal dependency footprint

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. We will publish a security advisory
2. Credit will be given to the reporter (if desired)
3. Details will be shared after a reasonable disclosure period
4. A patch will be released as soon as possible

## Contact
