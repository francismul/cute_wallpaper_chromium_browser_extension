# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often require this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation dialog)

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use bright, cute colors (pastels work well)
- Include elements like flowers, hearts, or cute animals
- Make sure the icon is recognizable at small sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Follow Google's Material Design principles

## Suggested Design:
A cute flower or heart shape with soft gradient colors from pink to purple, matching the extension's color scheme (#667eea to #764ba2).

## Creating Icons:
You can use tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators (like DALL-E, Midjourney)

## For Development:
You can temporarily use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images just to test the extension functionality.
