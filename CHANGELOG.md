### 🎉 Major Rewrite - "Cute Wallpapers Reborn"

This version represents a complete rewrite and rebranding from the original "Cute Wallpapers Extension" to "Random Wallpaper Extension" with a TypeScript-first architecture.

### Added

#### 🎨 **Options Page & Settings Management**
- Comprehensive settings interface (no more code editing!)
- API key management: add, test, and delete keys via UI
- **Persistent API test status** - Test results saved across sessions
- Multiple API keys per source support
- Search keyword preferences for custom image themes
- Auto-refresh configuration (5-300 seconds)
- Clock display settings (12/24-hour format, optional seconds)
- Cache statistics dashboard with relative time display
- Visual status indicators (green=working, red=failed, gray=untested)

#### ⚡ **Immediate Fetch System**
- **No waiting for 6-hour cycle** when adding API keys
- Instant background fetch triggered on settings save
- 10-second cooldown to prevent API spam
- Smart detection of settings changes
- Background message passing for reliability

#### 🛡️ **Fallback System**
- 20 high-quality default images from Unsplash
- Works immediately without API keys required
- Automatic fallback on API failures
- User notification with setup guidance
- Seamless first-time user experience
- No broken states or empty screens

#### 📈 **Enhanced Image Fetching**
- **Unsplash**: 30 images per fetch (API maximum)
- **Pexels**: 50 images per fetch (optimized from max 80)
- **Total**: 80 images per 6-hour refresh cycle
- Keyword search support for both APIs
- Single API support (works with just Unsplash OR Pexels)
- Random API key rotation for load distribution

#### 🕐 **Digital Clock Feature**
- Live clock display on new tab page
- Toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour format
- Optional seconds display with real-time updates
- Configurable via options page
- Beautiful design matching wallpaper aesthetic

#### 🎲 **True Cryptographic Randomness**
- Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for hardware-based entropy
- Cryptographically secure random selection
- Applied to image selection and API key rotation
- No patterns or biases in distribution
- Fair selection across all cached images

#### 📊 **Improved Cache Statistics**
- Relative time display ("2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- Total, valid, and expired image counts
- Breakdown by source (Unsplash vs Pexels)
- Last fetch timestamp with smart formatting
- Clear cache functionality

### Changed

#### 🏗️ **Complete Architecture Rewrite**
- Migrated from JavaScript to **TypeScript**
- Modern build system using **esbuild**
- Manifest V3 compliance throughout
- Chrome Alarms API for reliable scheduling
- chrome.storage.local for settings synchronization
- IndexedDB for efficient image caching
- ES2020 module system

#### 🔄 **Background Worker Improvements**
- 6-hour automatic refresh (unchanged but more reliable)
- Service worker sleep-aware wake-up checks
- Fallback integration for zero-config startup
- Immediate fetch handler for options page
- Better error handling and recovery
- Cleanup of expired images before fetch

#### 🎨 **New Tab Page Enhancements**
- Auto-refresh with configurable intervals
- Digital clock display
- Refresh button for instant new image
- Settings button for quick access to options
- Fallback notification (only shown when using defaults)
- Smooth fade-in animations
- Photo credits with clickable links

### Removed (Temporarily - Better Implementation Coming!)
- 🔄 **Video background support** - Will be reimplemented with better performance and controls
- 🔄 **Inspirational quotes feature** - Will return with customizable quote sources and styling
- ✅ **config.example.ts** - Permanently replaced by Options Page UI (better UX)
- ✅ **Manual code editing for API keys** - Permanently replaced by Options Page (no going back!)
- ✅ **30-minute refresh cycle** - Replaced by 6-hour cycle for API efficiency (this is the way forward)

**Note**: Video backgrounds and quotes will return in future updates with improved implementations. The 6-hour refresh cycle is here to stay as it balances freshness with API rate limits.

### Technical Improvements
- **Storage Strategy**: chrome.storage.local + IndexedDB separation
- **Build System**: TypeScript → ES2020 via esbuild
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 90%+ with smart expiry management
- **API Efficiency**: Reduced requests with 6-hour cycle + immediate fetch on demand
- **Randomness**: Crypto-secure selection using Web Crypto API
- **Reliability**: Chrome Alarms persist across browser restarts
- **Performance**: Instant load from IndexedDB (<100ms)

### Migration from v1.x (Cute Wallpapers)
- Repository renamed: `cute-wallpaper-extension` → `random-wallpaper-extension`
- All settings now managed via Options Page
- No video support (image-focused experience)
- Longer refresh cycle (6 hours vs 30 minutes)
- More images per fetch (80 vs previous counts)
- TypeScript codebase (was JavaScript)

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Zero configuration required (works with fallback images)
- ✅ Immediate feedback when adding API keys
- ✅ Persistent API test status
- ✅ Relative time display (more human-readable)
- ✅ No waiting for 6-hour cycle on first setup
- ✅ Better error handling and user guidance
- ✅ Clean, modern options interface
