## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-XX

### Added

#### üíæ **True Offline Mode**

- **Blob Storage**: Downloads and stores complete image blobs (~2-5MB each) in IndexedDB
- **Complete Offline Functionality**: Works without internet after initial cache
- **Storage Size**: ~160-400MB total for 80 cached images
- **Memory Management**:
  - Object URLs created with `URL.createObjectURL()` for blob display
  - Automatic cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to prevent memory leaks
  - Cleanup on image change, preload completion, and page unload
- **Parallel Downloads**: Fetches all blobs concurrently for faster caching
- **Fallback Blobs**: 20 default images also downloaded as blobs
- **Progress Logging**: Console logs show download progress and blob count

#### üé¨ **Smooth Animation Transitions**

- **GPU-Accelerated Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transitions using CSS transform and opacity
- **Crossfade Effect**: New images fade in smoothly over the previous image without flashing
- **Smart Preloading**: Images preloaded in background before display to ensure instant transitions
- **No Loading Flash**: Removed loading indicators for seamless blob-to-display pipeline
- **Performance Optimized**: 60fps transitions with proper image cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Directional Animations**: Different animations based on navigation context (fade for random, slide for history)

#### üìú **Image History Navigation**

- **IndexedDB History Store**: FIFO queue tracking viewed images with automatic size management
- **Previous/Next Navigation**: Arrow buttons to navigate through recently viewed images
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Arrow keys (‚Üê/‚Üí) for quick history navigation
- **Hover-Only Controls**: Navigation arrows appear only on hover to keep UI clean
- **Position Indicator**: Visual indicator showing current position in history (e.g., "3/15")
- **Configurable History Size**: Adjustable max history items (5-50) via options page
- **History Statistics**: View total history count and clear history from options
- **Smart History Management**:
  - Auto-removes oldest entries when limit reached
  - Tracks duplicates for accurate chronology
  - Previous button navigates back through history
  - Next button always loads a new random image
- **Persistent Navigation**: History survives page refresh and browser restarts

### Changed

- **API Fetching**: Now downloads complete image files instead of just metadata
- **Image Display**: Converts blobs to object URLs instead of direct URL references
- **Storage Strategy**: Increased from ~16KB (URLs) to ~160-400MB (blobs) for offline support
- **IndexedDB Schema**: Upgraded to v2 with new history object store
- **Navigation UI**: Removed refresh button, next arrow always shows new random image
- **Transition System**: Complete rewrite using JavaScript-based crossfade for smooth, flash-free animations

- Works immediately without API keys required
- Automatic fallback on API failures
- User notification with setup guidance
- Seamless first-time user experience
- No broken states or empty screens

#### üìà **Enhanced Image Fetching**

- Fair selection across all cached images

#### üìä **Improved Cache Statistics**

- Relative time display ("2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
